## âœ¨ News

- **28 Nov 2024**: Tin Hau v0.81 is released. This version can support **multi-resolution forecasting**. Apply for access at [`application form`](https://forms.gle/2BCMR76fZAdb3rAx5).
- **27 Sep 2024**: Tin Hau v0.8 is released. This is a publicly available version and the code is included in this repository.

## Introduction

Tin Hau is a time-series foundation model for building load/energy forecasting which embeds the knowledge of thousands of 
buildings and adopts an advanced training strategy.
Thus, for different buildings with different contexts (e.g., dining areas, sports areas, etc), Tin Hau can perform accurate 
forecasting with limited (i.e., few-shot forecasting) or even no knowledge (i.e., zero-shot forecasting) about the target building.
The model is developed based on Tiny Time Mixer.

## Usage

### Step 1: initial setup
Clone the repository using the following command.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dylan0211/TinHau-forecasting.git
```
The supported python version is 3.8. Use the following command to install required packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: prepare raw data file
- The target building energy data should be stored in a `{target_building}.csv` file with two columns:
    - **timestamp_column** is the column that contains the timestamp of the time-series (e.g., "time").
    - **target_columns** are the columns to be forecasted (e.g., "power").
    
- The `{target_building}.csv` file should be put under `dataset/{dataset_name}/`.
    - An example is the `Fox_office_Joy.csv` file under `dataset/Genome/`.

        |  | time | power |
        | :-----: | :----: | :----: |
        | 1 | 2016-12-29 12:00:00 | 205.47 |
        | 2 | 2016-12-29 13:00:00 | 206.74 |
        | 3 | 2016-12-29 14:00:00 | 206.77 |
        | 4 | 2016-12-29 15:00:00 | 205.77 |
        | 5 | 2016-12-29 16:00:00 | 201.93 |


### Step 3: config data loader
- The config of the target building should be specified for the data loader. Specifically, a config dict for the target 
building should be added to the `get_data()` function under `tsfm_public/models/tinytimemixer/utils/ttm_utils.py`. 
An example is shown as follows. Here, **"Genome"** is the name of the config dict (the same as the `{dataset_name}`) 
which contains variables to be specified:
    - **"timestamp_column"** is the name of the column that contains the timestamp of the time-series.
    - **"target_columns"** are the names of the columns that contains the variable to be forecasted.
    - **"split_config"** specifies the proportion of data used for training and testing. Here we set training ratio as 
  0.1 such that only 10% data will be used for few-shot forecasting.

  ```python
  # ttm_utils.py
  def get_data(
    dataset_name: str,
    file_name: str,
    data_root_path: str,
    context_length=512,
    forecast_length=96,
    fewshot_fraction=1.0,
  ):
    print(context_length, forecast_length)

    config_map = {
        "Genome": {  # for evaluating Genome
            "dataset_path": file_name,
            "timestamp_column": "time",
            "target_columns": ["power"],
            "split_config": {
                "train": 0.1,
                "test": 0.9,
            },
        },
    }
  ```

### Step 4: evaluate the model on the target building
- Evaluation can be conducted by running the `eval.py`. There are some parameters to be adjusted.
    - **dataset_name** is the name of your dataset, i.e.,`{dataset_name}`.
    - **file_name** is the name of the target building, i.e.,`{target_building}`.
    - **evaluation_mode** is the way for evaluation. This can be either 'zeroshot' or 'fewshot'.
    - **horizon_length** is the forecasting length. This value can be **any positive integer**.
  
  ```python
  # eval.py
  if __name__ == '__main__':
    # note: parameters that need to be adjusted
    dataset_name = "Genome"
    file_name = 'Fox_office_Joy'
    horizon_length = 96  # forecasting length (can be any positive integer)
    evaluation_mode = 'zeroshot'  # zeroshot, fewshot
  ```
- An example of evaluation output is shown as follows. Here the black line is the input time-series data, the black line
and the grey line are the forecasted result and the ground truth, respectively.
There are two metrics supported, i.e., mean absolute error 
(MAE) and coefficient variation of the root mean squared error (CV-RMSE).

## Feedback
Note that this is an early version of Tin Hau so we admit that there may be some building contexts where our
model perform poorly on.
In order to continuously improve Tin Hau, we are willing to hear your feedbacks or questions.
Therefore, if you encounter any problem when trying to run our model on your target building or you find that the performance of 
our model is not satisfying on your data, you can post issues on GitHub [`issue`](https://github.com/Dylan0211/TinHau-forecasting/issues) to describe the problem or share your experience.
We will check these issues occasionally and provide explanations or opinions.
